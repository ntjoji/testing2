# Online-Forever
Make Your Discord Account 24/7 Online!

----

A code written in Python that helps you to keep your account 24/7 online.

#### Please check out this if you want to add multiple tokens with just one file: [phantom.sellix.io/product/635d5774050c1](https://phantom.sellix.io/product/635d5774050c1)

The [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/main.py) is the main file. [keep_alive.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/keep_alive.py) prevents your repl from going to sleep. If you have a replit hacker plan or want to run the script locally, then you can delete [this file](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/keep_alive.py) and paste this code inside the [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/main.py) file:

```py
import os
import sys
import json
import time
import requests
import websocket

status = "online"

usertoken = os.getenv("TOKEN")
if not usertoken:
  print("[ERROR] Please add a token inside Secrets.")
  sys.exit()

headers = {"Authorization": usertoken, "Content-Type": "application/json"}

validate = requests.get('https://discordapp.com/api/v9/users/@me', headers=headers)
if validate.status_code != 200:
  print("[ERROR] Your token might be invalid. Please check it again.")
  sys.exit()

userinfo = requests.get('https://discordapp.com/api/v9/users/@me', headers=headers).json()
username = userinfo["username"]
discriminator = userinfo["discriminator"]
userid = userinfo["id"]

def onliner(token, status):
    ws = websocket.WebSocket()
    ws.connect('wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=9&encoding=json')
    start = json.loads(ws.recv())
    heartbeat = start['d']['heartbeat_interval']
    auth = {"op": 2,"d": {"token": token,"properties": {"$os": "Windows 10","$browser": "Google Chrome","$device": "Windows"},"presence": {"status": status,"afk": False}},"s": None,"t": None}
    ws.send(json.dumps(auth))
    online = {"op":1,"d":"None"}
    time.sleep(heartbeat / 1000)
    ws.send(json.dumps(online))

def run_onliner():
  os.system("clear")
  print(f"Logged in as {username}#{discriminator} ({userid}).")
  while True:
    onliner(usertoken, status)
    time.sleep(30)

run_onliner()
```
